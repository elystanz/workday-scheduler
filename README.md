## <a id="introduction">Introduction</a>
Work Day Scheduler is a simple application that can be used to plan out your workday. This calendar runs on Dolly Parton time (9-5), with the hours changing color according to the current time.

Save your tasks and recall them upon refresh or exiting the page!

## <a id="roadmap">Roadmap</a>
The plans for future development include improving the issue of localStorage not persisting the data properly. As of now, it will only save the first task to localStorage, and will save the others but with the same value as the first, though the key will adjust accordingly. Furthermore, the ability to adjust the hours for a variety of work schedules is a plan!
